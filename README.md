# Deep Learning with Pure Numpy

Welcome to the Deep Learning Algorithm Examples project! This project is designed to better understand the fundamental concepts of deep learning, such as forward propagation, backward propagation, hidden layers, and activation functions, as well as how these concepts come together to form deep learning algorithms.

## Deep Learning Concepts

Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that mimics the workings of the human brain to solve various problems. It involves feature learning and pattern recognition through multi-layer neural networks and is widely applied in image processing, natural language processing, and other domains. This project aims to introduce core deep learning concepts to provide you with a solid foundation for further exploration and application in this field.

## Why Use Pure NumPy

In this project, I have chosen to implement deep learning algorithms using pure NumPy. This decision is made to facilitate a better understanding of how the algorithms work without the encapsulation of deep learning frameworks. I hope that by doing so, I can help you gain a deeper understanding of deep learning and enable you to implement and customize algorithms on your own.
